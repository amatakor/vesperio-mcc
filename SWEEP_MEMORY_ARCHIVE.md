Dated SWEEP_MEMORY.md sections older than 30 days, moved here verbatim by

## Task 13 registry fill crawl (2026-07-05)

- 2026-07-05-K: Launch Library API versioning. 2.2.0 `/launches/` list
  endpoints return 404; use 2.3.0 for launch lists. 2.2.0
  `/config/launcher/` pages still resolve. Unauthenticated rate limit is
  ~15 req/hr, so fetch bulk snapshots once and work from the saved file
  instead of per-entity calls.
- 2026-07-05-L: Launch Library location records carry an `active: true`
  database boolean. It is NOT a stated operational status; never publish
  it as a status value.
- 2026-07-05-M: Collector agents repeatedly inferred `country` from city
  names or office addresses. A country field needs the country name
  literally stated on the cited page.
- 2026-07-05-N: Collector agents sometimes fabricate plausible quotes
  (caught on astroscale, unseenlabs, starlink, and JAXA pages, plus an
  invented full date for Uchinoura's 1970 launch against a year-only
  source). Adversarial re-fetch verification against every cited source
  is mandatory before publishing crawled facts.
- 2026-07-05-O: Unreachable-from-fetcher sites this run: fcc.gov
  (timeouts, even via curl), Space Force *.spaceforce.mil (403),
  rocketlabusa.com (403), orbex.space (502), he360.com, ghgsat.com,
  starlink.com (JS app). unoosa.org needs a browser user agent via curl.
- 2026-07-05-P: Redirects and rebrands: maxar.com redirects to
  vantor.com (Vantor rebrand); oneweb.net redirects to eutelsat.com;
  Amazon now calls Kuiper "Amazon Leo" on official pages.

## Filtered-source sweep, 08:58-18:07 UTC window (2026-07-05)

- 2026-07-05-Q: Scope judgment call: excluded a SpaceNews report on ESA
  authorizing Airbus to begin Aeolus-2 wind-lidar satellite development
  (EUR51M initial phase, 2034 target launch). It satisfies the letter of
  "government procurement of commercial space services" and Airbus is a
  tracked source, but it reads as legacy institutional weather-science
  procurement via a heritage prime, not a new-space-economy event in the
  spirit of the site (contrast with the Portugal/Norway ICEYE deals,
  which are agile-constellation operators winning sovereign contracts).
  Flag for Florian if that read is wrong; if it recurs, worth an explicit
  scope note for ESA/Eumetsat Earth-science procurement via legacy primes.
- 2026-07-05-R: SEC EDGAR atom feeds need a real contact-style
  User-Agent ("VesperioMCC-Sweep contact@vesperio.ai"); a bare product
  token without contact info (e.g. just "VesperioMCC-Sweep/1.0") still
  gets a 403 "Undeclared Automated Tool" page even though it looks like
  a User-Agent is set.
- 2026-07-05-S: A short, narrow re-check window (same-day, ~9 hours
  since the last sweep) against a small filtered source list is a
  legitimate sweep shape distinct from the 30-day backfill runs earlier
  today; all 12 named sources came back unchanged from the prior run
  except one fresh SpaceNews story, and zero items shipped. A quiet
  sweep with a documented scope call is a valid outcome, not a gap in
  coverage.

## Deep registry crawl (2026-07-05, second session)

- 2026-07-05-Q: WebFetch returns summarized page text; "verbatim" quotes
  drawn from it can be paraphrase. Verification must re-check against the
  live page, and collectors must not trust the summarizer's wording for
  quote fields (this systematically broke Sentinel operator quotes).
- 2026-07-05-R: More collector traps that recur: byline-relative dates
  ("yesterday", "today") are not calendar dates; press-release publication
  dates are not always the event date; state-media pages often state only
  a weekday, day precision needs the dateline to corroborate; "optical"
  must not be asserted when a page only says panchromatic/multispectral;
  " (per [outlet])" belongs only on true trade-press citations, not a
  company's own release.
- 2026-07-05-S: Fetchable-outlet map for this network: Payload, Via
  Satellite, The Register, TechCrunch (mostly), Reuters (sometimes),
  IonQ/Amazon newsrooms, telesat.com, capellaspace.com, astroscale.com,
  isaraerospace.com, rfa.space, stokespace.com, fireflyspace.com load;
  blueorigin.com 429s; rocketlabusa/corp.com, spaceforce.mil, SEC EDGAR,
  fcc.gov, pib.gov.in 403/timeout; spacenews.com 429s under load;
  businesswire times out; ghgsat.com/he360.com/oqtec unreachable.
- 2026-07-05-T: Launch Library /2.3.0/agencies/ records (founding_year,
  description, country, info_url) are an eligible structured-data source
  that fills org fields when corporate sites block fetchers; featured=true
  returns the majors in one request.
- 2026-07-05-U: Concurrency: ~25 simultaneous agents triggered server-side
  API rate limiting that killed nearly a whole fan-out. Keep waves at 3-5
  agents; forbid sub-agent spawning in collector prompts explicitly.
